# Light-Reflection-v1.0
This is a Python program that simulates light reflecting off of a curved surface. It comes with a very easy to customize config so it's easy to edit.

To run this you can either download both the main.py and settings.py seperately or download the zip file and extract it. As long as the main.py and settings.py file are in the same directory it should work no issues. Run the program using the main.py file and edit the contents of settings.py if you want to change any of the values inside of the program.
